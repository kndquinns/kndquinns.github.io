                <p class="text-accent line-space--medium ff-sans-normal">I am a private tutor and have a Masters degree in Science from Yale University, CT. I used to teach in a large school but then I quit that to start working 
                    independently to achieve my goals and I was soon rewarded with a much better position than before.
                    I have all sorts of tutoring experience; teaching students from elementary school all the way up to year 12, homeschooled and non-homeschooled, as well as 
                    college and university students and have had wonderful experiences teaching those students all these years.
                    <p class="uppercase fs-400 letter-spacing-1 ff-sans-cond ff-serif bottom-space--large">WHY I CHOSE TO TEACH</p><p  class="text-accent line-space--medium">
                        I grow at seeing my students succeed. I cherish helping them up, watching them and aiding them to grow. 
                        The immense sense of fulfillment I attain from helping other humans is why I chose this line of work and 
                        continue it with a passion even today.

                <p class="text-accent line-space--medium"> Parents, you are the most important people in a students life. You provide them with support and caregiving, and with love and passion you grow 
                    them into the pride-bringing heroes they become.

                    <p class="text-accent line-space--medium fs-300 line-space--small">“Raylando was afraid and had lost confidence in 
                        his exams and studies. I needed help and fast. Kevin is our tutor and we love him!
                        His style is crystal clear and he is quite patient, and Raylando’s enthusiasm for Chemistry has returned! 
                        Fingers crossed an A+ is in the bag!”</p>
                    <p class="uppercase fs-300 letter-spacing-2 ff-sans-cond ff-serif bottom-space--small ">James, Mary’s Father</p>
                    <p class="text-accent line-space--medium fs-300 line-space--small">“Mary loves the practical approach you have to tutoring, the tips on how to do well on the test specifically, from how to understand the questions, 
                        to the ‘pre-test’ study and to what to focus on while preparing. It feels more like he is a coach than a teacher and is very encouraging.”</p>

                    My approach to tutoring is to consider every student as an individual and to make learning fun. I believe passionately in the huge value of teaching, 
                    taking great satisfaction in seeing my students achieve their full potential. Most importantly, I have a passion for the subjects that I teach and I try 
                    to pass that enthusiasm on to my students too; as a happy student is a successful student.</p></p>

                <p class="text-accent line-space--medium"> Books act as a light in the midst of the darkness of illiteracy, so we can find knowledge. 
                    Knowledge is the gateway of success academically and individually and by reading, studying and acquiring knowledge, we blossom and become. 
                    Books are our lifelong friends, and you can take it from someone who has a bookshelf filled with books 
                    that they definitely will not let you down in an exam … as long as you’ve read them once or twice.
                    <p class="uppercase fs-400 letter-spacing-2 ff-sans-cond ff-serif bottom-space--small">My Method</p>
                    <p class="text-accent line-space--medium fs-300 line-space--small">Students find my techniques very easy to relate to, therefore excelling in their exams. As my student I will teach you 
                    the principles of the subject whereby you can answer any questions. I will work with you towards your success.
                    <p class="uppercase fs-400 letter-spacing-2 ff-sans-cond ff-serif bottom-space--small">A lifesaver</p>
                    <p class="text-accent line-space--medium fs-300 line-space--small">During my teaching, I have helped students when they needed it most, and allowed them to regain their confidence. Students that I have tutored 
                    have gone from D's to A's and B's, and this honestly is a very rewarding experience.</p>
